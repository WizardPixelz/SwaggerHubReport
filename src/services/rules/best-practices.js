/**
 * Best Practice Rules Reference
 *
 * NOTE: Validation rules are now managed in SwaggerHub via the
 * Standardization feature (style guide / Spectral rulesets).
 *
 * The validation pipeline fetches rule violations from:
 *   GET /apis/{owner}/{api}/{version}/standardization
 *
 * To customise rules, update your organisation's style guide in
 * SwaggerHub → Organisation Settings → Standardization, or use
 * the Spectral Rulesets API:
 *   GET/PUT /standardization/spectral-rulesets/{owner}/{name}/zip
 *
 * The validation engine (validation-engine.js) then categorises
 * and scores the results returned by SwaggerHub.
